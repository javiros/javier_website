          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I finished secondary school with a diploma in electronics, back in those days I sued to spend a lot of time won my Commodore 64 typing away code to create games and small databases; however my desire to travel lead me to study Hospitality Management in College. This allowed me to travel the world and to meet really cool people, but I always kept an eye on techy stuff!
        </p>
        <p>After spending over 12 years in the hospitality industry and working in some of the most exclusive hotels in Ireland and overseas I moved into retail as Store manager, spending over 6 years with a FMCG discount retailer. This gave me a great overview of the business in general, from staff management to budgeting and stock control.
         Both these jobs taught me a lot about team work, looking after the customer (internal and external) and the real need for training and developing staff.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, now with a family to look after, I decided to return to my roots and enrolled myself in the H. Dip in Web Tech and did quite well out of it. The course was very intensive and challenging but I enjoyed every minute of it and finished with a 1.1 overall grade.</p>
        <p>Now I am actively looking for a junior software developer position, preferably in Ruby on Rails and looking forward to working with senior developers from whom I can learn from, but also love a challenge and having my own feature to develop would be great!</p>
